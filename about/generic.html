										<h5>Biography</h5>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/DSC_0762.jpg" height="25%" width="25%" alt="" /></span>Hi there. My name is Sarah Mae Martin. I'm a senior at Ayala High School. I'm seventeen years old. My birthday is on August 26, 1999. I have one older sister who's twenty-one years old. My favorite poem always changes, but my current favorite is called <s>Beginning, Middle, and End by Phil Kaye</s>Repetition by Phil Kaye. Not really sure why I had to say that next. If you look below, I have nine chickens. Sadly, two of them died, one of them being the only rooster of the bunch. Somehow I became vegetarian and have been since the end of sophomore year, so about one and a half years now. It's especially hard when it constantly conflicts with the traditions of Filipino culture. But who knows? Maybe one day I'll come out with a cookbook. I'm taking AP Literature, AP Calculus, AP French 4, AP Computer Science, AP Economics, and Yearbook. I love most of my teachers. Are you really reading this far? If you are, you should know that I love Marvel and DC. I love Steve Rogers especially. I still can’t get over Agent 13. I have so many other characters I like. Bucky, Flash, Arrow, just to name a few. If you haven't noticed already, this has turned into a stream of consciousness because I'm too lazy to format the picture to somehow be smaller so I don't have to write as much text. That’s all I got to say. It's been great writing for you. Maybe next time you read me, it'll be a poem.</p>
